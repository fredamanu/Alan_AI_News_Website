## Introduction
This is a code respository for a React-Vite Typescript News Application integrated with Artificial Intelligence using Alan AI. 

Alan AI is a revolutionary speech recognition software that allows you to add voice capabilities to your applications. This app allows you to control everything in it using your voice. You can ask for news from a category, on a topic or just the latest news and top headlines. 

You can also tell Alan to read the headlines of each news article or open a particular aticle by specifying the article number on the list and Alan will open the article on the main website.


Setup:
- run '''npm i & npm run dev''' to start the website on your local machine
